          <p class="description">
            <strong>H’Evans Honey</strong> is a small local Utah company dedicated to providing the best quality 100% raw honey products to the community.
            I decided to design and develop a small, user-friendly website as an online platform to display their products and broaden their online presence.
            The website not only showcases their range of delectable honey varieties but also serves as a digital gateway for honey enthusiasts to explore 
            the unique flavors and benefits of their products. With a clean and intuitive design, the site offers a seamless user experience, making it
            easier for customers to discover, learn, and connect with H’Evans Honey, while also supporting local businesses in the process.

            <strong>RecipesForU</strong>  is a website concept I created that would provide free access to a variety of quality recipes and offer fresh 
            delivered ingredients at an affordable price. I meticulously crafted the website's design for optimal user experience. The intuitive layout,
             clean navigation, and appealing visuals make exploring the recipe collection effortless. I paid close attention to ensure that the design 
             not only promotes user engagement but also places a strong emphasis on usability, making it available to any individual, regardless of their
              background or experience.

          <p class="description">
            <strong>Salt N Sugars</strong> is an re-imagined website design and development for a small restaurant that unites a bakery, cafe, and diner to
             provide a large variety of delicious food made from fresh ingredients for its cherished customers.
             In this project, I designed a streamlined, one-page design that presents the restaurant's diverse menus in an impeccably organized
             layout, offering users a visually appealing platform to explore the scrumptious offerings. The menu items, complete with their 
             prices, are elegantly showcased, ensuring that visitors can effortlessly peruse the restaurant's offerings, making dining decisions 
             a delightful and straightforward experience.
